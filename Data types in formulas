Create a solution that accepts any three integer inputs representing the base (b1, b2) and height (h) measurements of a trapezoid in meters. Output the exact area of the trapezoid in square meters as a float value. The exact area of a trapezoid can be calculated by finding the average of the two base measurements, then multiplying by the height measurement.

Trapezoid Area Formula:
A = [(b1 + b2) / 2] * h

The solution output should be in the format

Trapezoid area: area_value square meters
